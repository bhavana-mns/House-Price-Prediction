# House-Price-Prediction

This is a Data Analytics Project
The Objective is to build models using regression and check the correctness of the predicted model with actual data, and to come up with the best model. (i.e., the one model which is the closest to the predicted model) and analyse the features of that model

Dataset Used: “House Sales in King County”
Feature Extraction, and importance of features is visualized
Three models are built - Decision Tree, Linear Regression, XGB Tree
